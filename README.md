🎯 Project Features
🔹 1. Multithreading for Concurrent Operations
Efficient Resource Management: Utilizes Java's Thread class to manage multiple parking operations simultaneously.
Responsive System: Ensures that tasks such as vehicle entry, exit, and payment processing do not block each other, providing a smooth user experience.
🔹 2. Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP)
Encapsulation: Data members are private, accessed through getters/setters.
Inheritance: Structured hierarchy among classes to promote code reuse.
Polymorphism: Function overloading and overriding for flexible operations.
🔹 3. Database Integration
Persistent Data: Utilizes SQL databases to store information about vehicles, parking slots, and transactions.
Data Integrity: Ensures consistency and reliability of data through ACID properties.
🔹 4. User-Friendly Interface
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides a straightforward and intuitive way for users to interact with the system.
Menu-Driven Navigation: Users can navigate through various options seamlessly.
🔹 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
Robust Error Detection: Identifies and manages errors gracefully to prevent application crashes.
User Feedback: Provides clear messages to users in case of invalid operations or inputs.
